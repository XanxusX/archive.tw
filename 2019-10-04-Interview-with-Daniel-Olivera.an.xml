                        Yeah. As I mentioned in my talk, I dropped out of junior high school as soon as I turned 15 years old, but it was the blessing of the rector of my junior high school.

                        I told her that education is happening on the World Wide Web, which was just invented at that time. My textbooks were out of date. She agreed and so the principal actually covered for me while I studied with my friends on the World Wide Web, and later co-founded a startup.

                        As I explained in my talk, I think it’s important to get into everybody’s mind that broadband access to the Internet at affordable cost is a human right. Everything else follows from this.

                        Indeed, when I was 15 year old but I cannot pay for the Internet access, I cannot quit school. I must be confined into the old education system. Universal access to the Internet would be the first thing that I will try to get everybody to accept as the norm of our times.

                        In Argentina, there is broad access to Internet. It’s comparatively very cheap, but we still don’t see this cultural change.

                        First of all, I think there is a difference between Internet access in the majority of population and Internet access as a human right. It’s a different idea.

                        Even in the most rural, most mountainous, most indigenous place in Taiwan, we make sure that we build broadband access. Even in places where people cannot afford tablets, we’ll make sure there’re library, carry fresh enough, like new in the past three years, tablets for people to lend to use as productivity tools.

                        I think the society only moves forward as a whole if people can see that their innovation work even for the poor, the least connected people. I think that actually increases the motivation for people to innovate for the whole society, not just for a few municipalities.

                        Even with access, here the Internet is seen as something for entertainment, for fun. How do you make a cultural shift so that it’s determined as a space for education?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        I think the important thing here is that the teachers must not see themself as holders of standard answers. In Taiwan, when I was young, I don’t like the education system because it’s just one standard answer for many topics. Even if we think out of the box, nobody is rewarded for thinking out of the box to solve a problem in a shortcut.

                    <p>
                        Because my principal, being very open and liberal, accepted my shortcut, I was able to then work with the community online to change Taiwan’s thinking about the curriculum, starting this year, in all our basic education system, the teacher no longer hold the right answer, the standardized answer.

                    <p>
                        The teacher become a facilitator that learns with the student. The student determine which issues on the society, environment, or economy they want to solve. This problem-based learning is no longer just a few alternative schools, but part of our basic education.

                    <p>
                        Yes. I will use one example, also, with somebody that’s just 13 years old. When we roll out a new curriculum and a different way to teach mathematics and science, the people in the first year of junior high school are now presented and then met with a teacher that introduce this.
                    </p>

                        Suppose you’re the president of the islands of Taiwan and you’re faced with climate change and also with plastic waste problem, and you must introduce a circular economy plan. Otherwise, by the year 2030, that is to say when this person become an adult, Taiwan will be inhabitable.

                    <p>
                        The student actually very quickly connected to the Internet community caring about eco-design, about circular economy and wrote very long slides outlining their vision of the 2030 sustainable goals. The teacher said to the parent that “Oh, this must be a very gifted children because they design such a good plan.”

                        Parents said, “No, actually, before the new curriculum, they placed completely in the last of the class when it comes to mathematics, because there is no motivation to learn mathematics. Now, because understanding that when they become an adult, the earth will be an inhabitable place, unless they do something about it, they find the motivation to solve the problem.”

                        He really wants to connect your solutions to the concentration here because he thinks it’s very interesting. For example, it’s very common here to see that people are seeking a job. There are three blocks of people waiting in line expecting to be hired. What they have in their hands is a printed version of their resume. It’s very likely that their future boss would just throw it in the garbage.

                        Back when I started my first company, I did not actually start with any customers or any clients in sight. I only started with an idea that it should be easier for people who auction off their items online. That was around the time before eBay got very popular. We built the first C2C auction site in Taiwan.

                    <p>
                        That was only because we look at what we needed, our personal need, as well as innovative with people who share the same need, and then find a better way than storing it to a garage or to have a sale in the marketplace in the weekend, because that will only reach a limited number of people. You think online marketplace, we can reach a very wide variety of people, and build a community out of it.

                        I would suggest to start with your own needs but don’t do everything alone. Just find people around the world who are encountering the same issues, and then build on their innovations. There’s many innovations that are easy to replicate that doesn’t have a copyright or a patent. You don’t have to pay any fee or price. You can just start building with those appropriate technologies yourselves.

                        How do you reach this level of consensus because so far in Argentina, at least, the Internet has been a space of total confrontation? Instead of consensus, there’s differentiation. There’s conflict. How do you reach this stage where this space becomes a place to agree?

                        I think it’s important to note that our idea of 共識 or common understanding in Taiwan. It’s not the same word as the English word “consensus.” Common understanding means in Internet language “rough consensus,” meaning that we can live with it. It’s a lower threshold. A high consensus is something you can sign your name on. It’s actually very time consuming to reach a real consensus.

                        On Internet, because everybody’s participating part time, if you want that level of consensus, only people have the most time, have the time to stay with you, and they win the argument kind of by default because they have more time to spend on it. Just by asking not the question, “What is your perfect answer? What is the best idea?” we just say, “Oh, here are some ideas. Can you live with it?”

                        In order for any citizen to initiate a dialog of this kind with the national government, all they have to do is find 5,000 people to sign for them on the National Participation website. 5,000 people ensure a conversation, but it doesn’t have to be signatures. It could also be the local people decide to hold a workshop, a scenario planning workshop, on their common future of that precinct.

                        If they let the national government know, the national government also makes sure that as conversation happens to the local context. So one is the citizen bringing their issues to the national platform and one is they’re having their local issues but inviting the national public service to their local vicinity, and these two both work.

For example, we just, two days ago, concluded an online conversation about what do we do about lifting restrictions of hikers on our mountains, on mountaineering. This is a very big topic because Taiwan used to have a lot of restriction on climbing the mountains because of our authoritarian era regulations. We’re now relaxing them.

                        I think in Taiwan, because our constitution already said that it’s a republic of citizens (民國), within the constitution, there are already some roots for direct democracy or direct referendum to create new laws and direct democracy to determine the future of the country and not just representative politics. It’s always in the constitution.

                        Because people, even in the authoritarian era, hold these ideas as regulatory thoughts, like, “One day we will get there.” It’s still in generations of people educated in Taiwan that someday if the technology is right, that we don’t have to have a martial law anymore, someday we will have direct democracy. That’s well within the original ideas more than 100 years ago of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

                        It’s very fortunate that by the time we are lifting our martial law, partly, due to the fact that the personal computer is so easily accessible, people think about democracy when we had personal computers.

                        For us, it’s not about the elite bureaucrat controlling all the numbers, because when the time comes for democracy, everybody has their powerful machines called personal computers. The idea of direct access to information, for example, is from the very beginning after the lifting of the martial law. That enabled a strong social sector that has more legitimacy than the government.

                        The horizontal ministers enters the politics with the explicit mandate to make sure that the values that are incompatible across ministries must be made compatible by the horizontal minister. We call this the minister without portfolio. It sometimes have counterpart in other government. Just look for ministers without portfolio. This is not a new idea.

                        When they’re busy, they are distracted, they’re still attracted to the idea of public service because it’s fun. It demands only 15 seconds of their attention and they can understand the social issue in a very quick way.

                        After that, when they’re interested, they would donate 15 minutes of their time to start participating. If their idea became public policy, they would donate then 15 hours of their time for face-to-face consultations. It’s a gradual thing, but the first always starts with good communication.

                        Yes. Also, if it’s out of passion, it will just decrease over time. People burn out when they’re working on passion alone, but because it’s fun to meet new ideas and new people, I stay refreshed every day.

                        When I first stepped into the world of free software, I read a lot of the early anarchists’ work, people who are religious anarchists, and people who are anarchists because they have this idea of Daoism, of the natural order taking care of people’s needs without pushing too hard on it, of the Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu schools in old Warring States and the Springs and Autumns time.

                        I call myself a conservative anarchist. Conversation means that I respect the traditions of the indigenous Austronesian culture, of the ethnic Han culture with the lineage from Confucius and Lao Tzu and Mozi and so on.

                        I respect the traditions of our newer immigrations with their ideas around, for example, the Muslim idea or Christian ideas. All those culture traditions must be conserved and respected. That’s what conservative means to me. What anarchist means to me is just people starting to form common values without the need to give order or take order.

                        Many governments now, I think Australia and many Scandinavian countries had this idea of a digital ambassador, someone who works to communicate the philosophies of that country to the large multinationals like Facebook or Google and so on.
