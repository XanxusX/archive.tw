                    <p>
                        So, hello! Thanks a lot that you have time for us. I thank Renat that he built the contact. I’m Hernâni Marques. I am active in different projects. For example, in the Chaos Computer Club Switzerland, which is a hacker organization. It was first founded in Germany in the 1980s. Then in Switzerland, we also built such an organization.

                        We are fighting a lot for privacy, freedom of information, and also trying to avoid the government to like introduce e-voting – at least at this stage. Because we do not see how it can be done in a way that you can also trust the results in the end, especially…

                    <p>
                        What about collecting signatures?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That is something I wanted to ask you. That is called e-collecting and the government decided they have…

                    <p>
                        That might be easier.

                <speech by="#Hernâni Marques">
                    <p>
                        Yes, I think, because privacy is less of an issue, because – in Switzerland, at least – you write your name, your address, and your signature on paper.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is not private to begin with.

                    <p>
                        Yes. I mean, att least, if you do it in a way that you sign against your commune, so at the very low level, and then they like…
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Do a cryptographic verification of it.

                    <p>
                        Yes. Basically, they need a public key that they verify… if you have it. Then you can discuss how to do it exactly.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We are going to do it next year… for the e-collecting.

                    <p>
                        That is interesting. That is also your opinion – that we should start with such things?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Collecting? Of course, because it is less secret to begin with.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Hernâni Marques">
                    <p>
                        OK, great, yeah. The other thing, with this e-voting thing – at least if you do it with the secret ballot – anonymous in the end… imagine that Hong Kong would now make free elections with an e-voting, which is wrong… which contains components, let us say, of Mainland China or so. How trustworthy would the results be? [laughs]
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It would require two things. One, you would always have the in-the-place vote to override the e-vote. That is how Estonia does it, so that, if you’re coerced in some way, you can go and reverse your vote.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Second, it requires a cryptographically secure and cross-partisan trusted registry of people who can vote to guard against vote stuffing. Both, I think, is not primarily a technological problem. It is a social trust problem.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That is also a question we have, because, I mean, it is quite obvious and clear that Taiwan is threatened by Mainland China, let us say. What is your take on the discussions which are taking place in Europe, including also a little bit of Switzerland – but there they are, let us say, less ideologic, in a way. So, there is the discussion with…
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        You mean the cybersecurity discussion?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Hernâni Marques">
                    <p>
                        … I mean, there is discussion with Huawei, like about components from Huawei in 5G and stuff like that.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We do not talk about specific companies, but five years ago, we decided – as occupiers, but also as the cabinet collectively – that we do not allow PRC components in our 4G network, core or periphery.

                <speech by="#Hernâni Marques">
                    <p>
                        That I read in your transcripts. How do you achieve that? That is about supply chain security and stuff?

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Of course. It is also about making sure that no part of the supply chain can get in undetected. It is also a lot of, in our agency of what we call BSMI, B-S-M-I, which is like NIST, it must also make not only a blacklist of, “These are PRC components,” but also a white list, like, “These are the lab-tested components that are good for use in the telecommunication infrastructure.”

                    <p>
                        Maybe I can explain a little bit. Taiwan has a lot of manufacturing capabilities, a lot of manufacturing plants. Most notably, TSMC, which is one of…

                    <p>
                        Taiwan is perfectly capable of manufacturing their own telecommunication components, also, at semiconductor level.

                    <p>
                        That is actually why I am here, but we can come to that later. I will, Hernâni…

                <speech by="#Hernâni Marques">
                    <p>
                        No, you can do it now. That is the point. We think that – and we are also saying that in public all the time – we need public money, public code. That is like from the Free Software Foundation in Europe, that is like I think what they said. I think you are already working in that direction in Taiwan.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Yeah, we are more about public money, public data, and API, because when we realized that when people publish code and we will rely on a proprietary database, or rely on an existing monolithic code base that – even though technically open – nobody can quite penetrate. It is like the early Mozilla code base. Being open source really does not mean much.

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        We say, from the very beginning, that open source is good, and we use Linux Foundation standards, like Spedix to make sure that people can waive their warranties if they use Open Source. The more they use, the less responsibility of warranty you would have to take, so they are incentivized to use Open Source.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        What we are really requiring in procurement is that we say discriminating against robots is like discriminating against people with blindness. Open API is a machine-readable and writable part of a website. That is our way of doing it.

                        You also have this idea to make the government machine-readable?

                    <p>
                        That is nice, because that is something which the CCC is saying since the 1980s: the government must be transparent, and the people need to have privacy…

                    <p>
                        …nowadays, that is also a discussion point we might enter into – it is turned around. The people are fully transparent. Even here, we have everywhere… like cameras everywhere. We have to give our fingerprints when we enter the country.

                    <p>
                        So, also here you see such things everywhere. Switzerland, of course, does it everywhere. Not to start about Mainland China…

                        In Taiwan, though, when the Ministry of Interior collects your personal data identifiers for entry purposes, they must not share with any other ministry.

                    <p>
                        And technically, I mean, the components are also ensured that they are not from the US or from PRC?

                    <p>
                        There is two things. First is the communication component, which is the most important part. So, data is either like stored only locally, not transmitted anywhere, in which case, the manufacturer does not quite matter as much. And the second thing is that if there is communication component, these are lab-tested so that it only goes to the destination that it is intended to.

                    <p>
                        It must not cross ministerial boundaries. Unlike in many government where there is a single data processor shared by all the different parts of the government, here, each ministry gets its own DPA, and they must not share raw data. That reduce the tech service quite a bit.

                    <p>
                        OK, because Switzerland failed there. There was a WikiLeaks revelation where it was written that certain biometric readers, they have for biometric passports, were like subverted by the CIA. Then the government even confirmed it in parliament, and there was a left-wing politician, Balthasar Glättli, asking that… if that is true. They basically confirmed it, but could not provide any means how to counter it now.

They have their own, very isolated place. It actually takes longer, costs are higher, but we think it is worth it.

                        Yes, it is a lottery in reverse, exactly. I like that thought. The situation we have – what is LibreSilicon first? First, what is it? In general, to make it precisely, it is meant to be something like a meta foundry, meta factory – so that we can standardize manufacturing, the flow, which is not really fixed to certain machines, but it is really portable. This way, you can actually collaborate.

                        Developers from many countries can collaborate in designing IP cores – components in the chip, like telecommunication parts.

                        The entire design flow is open, so you can basically follow the design and can verify that these components are not compromised. For companies supporting LibreSilicon, the advantages, right now, they have to have money on the side, not only investment for the factory equipment, for building the factory.

                        They also need to invest money in R&#x26;D to develop their library to have components to develop the chips. LibreSilicon would turn this around by 180 degrees. You suddenly would have a continuously organically growing IP catalog, and foundries actually get paid to silicon-verify part of these components going into the catalog.

                        It would be already… for companies from a business perspective… it would be like an absolute improvement. Then the other thing is, of course, the security increase. That is from that thing, so we have improvement of security… of reliability of the chips. It is scalable – OK, that is my achievement, I made the process scalable. We use ULSI, but that is details.

                        Oh, yeah. Our process is actually antinode. There has been something called scalable CMOS in the open circuit design from Tim Edwards. There has been something like LibreSilicon, but only on digital level. It is called MOSIS design rules. We actually went one step further, and we said, “OK, now, we design, actually, we specify how a process flow has to look like.” That is the layers of the die.

                    <p>
                        That is the process step layers. That is the mask set we specify. You are free in how you manufacture the masks, because exposures, separate exposures are different in any fab. But you have parameters: for that is PearlRiver. The PearlRiver test wafer basically allows you to basically check whether your manufacturing line still is calibrated correctly to fit all the LibreSilicon parameters.

                        What you do when you manufacture for LibreSilicon, the first thing, first, you send through some wafers with the PearlRiver and measure out all the test devices over the wafer.

                        Yeah, so, actually, you can characterize every single manufacturing step of the process. Then something… you can actually automatize that with needle beds.

                    <p>
                        It is really, you let it verify automatically – you have a needle bed for your PearlRiver wafer. You put it on there, you measure out all the analog parameters, and when everything is fine, then you start producing.

                        They download the process spec. They adapt it to their machines. They make these mask sets from the online GDS2 files on git (Revision Control System), and then they can calibrate all the recipes until they match all the analog parameters.

                        I think the main problem is how to adjust costs. If you discovered a software bug, you just fix it, recompile it. With hardware design, if you have a problem, then you have to make a new PCB, manufacture a new PCB…

                        …also parts, and pay for the entire assembly. Now, we come to silicon. Silicon, if you have a problem, if you layout and then you have to pay another 2,000, 4,000 US dollars to make a new mask set… it is even more expensive. Then you have the entire operational cost. For instance, Professor Lee, he gave me an overview about the costs they have in the university lab.

                        Let us say the rent we pay is actually already a discount, I estimate. I really guess it is government-funded. The only way that actually can happen… LibreSilicon… in the long run would be if a government would say, “OK. You know what? It has enough of incentive. We have enough of incentive to actually take this project over and do it,” because private companies never will do that.

                        Back before Mozilla spawned, before modern version control, before modern continuous integration, the cost for software forks is not lower. It is arguably higher, if you count in hourly rate. Many proprietary companies then did not join the Free Software movement, not for ideological reasons, but just the economy did not justify.

                        Yeah, I think the problem is however, with semiconductor manufacturing… really, is that these fixed costs you have with operating a factory. They cannot be fixed with some version control. It is just really that programming just costs so much for a little. The same goes for phosphorous, chlorine, and equipment.

I read some papers on how to do it, and we discussed in Mumble last Sunday… that could actually be a product we could produce as company and sell.

                        Then you still have the fixed costs of running a lab. That means having the air pumps. The air does not pump itself through the HEPA filters. You actually have to have actual air-con, airflow planning. The operational costs of a lab just can go so low.

                        Well, I mean, you are already working with a professor, although I do not know him personally. There are, of course, semiconductor device labs in the NTU and many other universities around Taiwan, of course. The academic connection may just be enough, if you are just finding an HKUST alternative, rather than a full partner that will drive this idea forward. So, that is two different stages of things.

If you have enough people who voted, you can, of course, like count… let us say, 1,300 paper ballots by hand and then see if there is a big difference to what the screen is showing for the whole thing.

                        That is a really great project. There are lots of really great academic papers on that. It is not just about messaging, here is a subsystem called CADET, which is for end-to-end encrypted messages.

                        The point now, which I wanted to come to and connect it with that banking thing, is that pEp is a very general approach. It is agnostic to message formats and agnostic to the concrete crypto.

                    <p>
                        So, we can, by situation, use, let us say, PGP for email, because that is the default there, but if we add the XMPP transport, you can use OTR, or OMEMO. Or you can also use Signal Protocol for like messaging. That is completely open from the very beginning, and so the whole architecture is done in a way that it is flexible. It is that flexible that we are also using it now in banks.

                        Yeah. That is why the SWIFT consortium started to search for solutions how to have an easy, pluggable… if there is an easy pluggable way to just encrypt this stuff. Then they found pEp and started to now do proof of concepts with us. We are now working already with Swiss banks, and even with the Swiss National Bank.

The instant messages here, many people in the social sector and private sector use a product called Line, which is an end-to-end encrypted messenger, according to them, but it is not Open Source, so not independently verified.

                        Indeed. We have TECROs, which are de facto embassies. The TECRO head representatives are ambassadors. They carry diplomatic passports. They get diplomatic privileges.

                        You can treat them as an embassy. They will be happy because they are being treated as an embassy. That depends on, of course, how good the bilateral relationship is. Some countries, for example, the US with the Taiwan Relation Act, it basically enacts by law that the TECRO should be treated as an embassy. Their counterpart, the AIT in Taiwan, has the State Department seal. It is all but the name.

                    <p>
                        It is actually a full diplomatic, government-to-government relationship. In some countries, there are petitions going on – for example, in Germany right now, that want the German government to do something like the TRA. Of course, we are not thinking that this will happen just because of the petition. Nevertheless it is good to have a public discussion about it.

                    <p>
                        Because, indeed, with something like TRA, you can recognize Beijing as representing China while actually offering de facto full ambassarial relationship with Taiwan. That is not mutually exclusive. I do not know about the Swiss’ own politics but there also are countries like Bhutan, which specifically did not recognize either but do de facto with both. That is possible, too.

                        …which is centralized and run by, in the end, two companies, which is Swiss Post and Swisscom, in a centralized fashion – even in a way where it is written in their own risk report that a single inside attacker can like… leak everything. That is not acceptable.

                        That is is really fun. And this stuff always happens a little bit like this. So they just create a project and also the electronic ID – also Renat Künzi mentioned it, I read it.. That is also done, in our opinion, in a wrong way which will lead to identity theft, trust issues, and stuff like that. So this… this is systematic there.

                        We would like to have someone like you or, better, you to speak there in Switzerland opening up civic tech conference or so. And then we can do panels, and offer talks, and have a discussion if you can also… if Taiwan can also help here?

                        Sure. I just returned from Berlin. Before that, The Hague, before that, Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, and before that it was Osaka for Devcon and before that, Buenos Aires. I travel quite a bit. I already know that I will be in back to Berlin by end of March, early April. That is one point.

                        Maybe. These two are already kind of set-ish. The other things, we do not usually plan after May 20th because that is when the new Cabinet gets formed. For the next half-year or so, that is the two European trips that mostly likely will happen. Anything beyond May, of course, we will have to wait until the election.

                        A good argument for you to be physically there is that you could also talk with government officials like, say, from the Federal Chancellery and show them ways. Because they are still in a…

                        Then maybe you can draft out some outlines. We are also waiting for outline for the other Swiss… I think they are more academic. Anyway, we can send both to the Foreign Service and see what they think. Because I do not pay for that oversea travel budget; I am in a semi-diplomatic position when I travel abroad. And so the Foreign Service will decide. I will let you know as soon as possible.
