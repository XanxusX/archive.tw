                        Audrey, how important is pol.is to the whole process?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As you can see here, the Uber deliberation is the first time that we get more people’s statements than can possibly be processed by one, single moderator. Even a team of moderators wouldn’t be possible to accept more than 100 statements or people’s voices from tens of hundred. Let’s try again. [snaps]
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Even a dozen moderators wouldn’t be possible to process more than 100 statements and thousands of participants. At that time, if we keep processing these statements using traditional forum software, it will discard a lot of what’s in common.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Carl Miller">
                    <p>
                        Thousands of people were wanting to get involved in this domain.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Exactly. Also, people wouldn’t bother to read through the comments anyway, so a lot of redundancy will also be shown by people who enter their statements. However, pol.is let the moderation part be crowdsourced by everybody who participates. That is to say, by clicking simply agree or disagree on each statement, people help clustering themselves into folks with similar ideas.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Carl Miller">
                    <p>
                        Is it fair to say that policy is really core and central to any deliberation, where there’s more people than you can listen to without technology?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Exactly. This person is still listening to part of the participation process. Everybody helps to group like-minded people together. For example, as we can see here, in group A, they think the law enforcement against unregistered cars is a duty of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        Everybody in group A pretty much agrees on that, but almost nobody in group B agrees on that. Just by a simple gesture of clicking group A, everybody can understand what the groups’ main ideas are. They would not bother to repost the same statement. They can just click yes, to resonate with that statement.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Carl Miller">
                    <p>
                        Say we were just two people, normal people, that just cared about the Uber debate. What would be the first thing that we would see, when we logged into pol.is.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        You will see one statement from your fellow citizen, in this case, incidentally, Audrey Tang. [laughs] Obviously, I have used the Uber app to call a car. This is what we call a metadata statement, meaning that nowadays it will not be included in the clustering. This is not about your opinion or your feeling. This is about your lived experience.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        Nevertheless, it helps us to tell initial groups to see that there are Uber passengers on one side and passenger who have never taken Uber on the other side, how it correlates with their lifting experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It begins in quite a similar experience-wise way to Twitter or Facebook in a sense that it brings you face-to-face with a series of statements which other people have drafted. The origin is quite similar.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        The origin is similar. It is even more like Reddit where you have a upload and a download. This is like a upload and this is like a download. If you, say, agree with the statement, you will notice two things. First, that you have moved a little bit toward the right. Second, that you will see another statement.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Carl Miller">
                    <p>
                        You start receiving these statements. You start agreeing or disagreeing. You can’t reply. No trolling allowed. Crucially, then, I guess, the first big difference between this and the other platforms is this mapping. Is that correct?
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s right.

                    <p>
                        Why is the mapping so important?

                </speech>

                    <p>
                        It shows two things. First, even though I may be here – that’s my avatar – on this camp, my friends and families are here. They are not nameless trolls. They are not people belonging to another tribe. They are not others. They are my friends and families. I can see that they may have their points as well. It’s just that we never talk about this over dinner. That’s all.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It removes one of the main antagonism on the Internet which is that people paint other people with different thoughts as nameless others. That’s the first thing. The second thing is that it shows, despite the two different clusters, there are a long list, seven, of majority opinions.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That is to say, everybody across the aisle, almost no opposition, thinks that insurance against accidents is paramount, is important. No matter how Uber is legalized, anyone who drives a e-rental or e-taxi with the Uber app need to have insurance to cover for accidents.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        Step one is that it empathizes the other camp by deliberately showing you your friends and family that are in the other camp.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then, secondly, then it shows what we have in common. What happens in the journey next? We’ve maybe even drafter some comments at this point.
                    </p>
                </speech>

                    <p>
                        That’s right. After answering a few ideas, you can see this “share your perspective.” It reminds you that it should be a idea that stands alone, meaning that you shouldn’t write ten ideas in a single statement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It should raise new perspective and experience or issues, meaning that if you simply copy/paste that, it’s not going to make any difference. Finally, please be clear and concise by limiting to 140 characters, which is a one-vote Twitter.

                    <p>
                        What happens then at the time? Do we start to see different kind of groups emerge?

                    <p>
                        Very much so. Whereas here, you can see currently there’s only, broadly speaking, two camps, A and B, in 2015 when this deliberation first started, you can actually see four groups, one in each corner. There’s very little they have in common. At the moment, you can see that the rift is visually very small now.
                    </p>
                </speech>
                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        At that time, there’s almost no overlap between the four groups. The four groups are, roughly speaking, people who drive for Uber, people who drive for an existing taxi fleet, people who have taken before as passengers, and people who did not take Uber before as passengers. We know this composition because we asked those metadata questions.

                        No, not particularly. I made a point of trying everything emergent that we deliberate here. Even before we deliberate Airbnb, I register Airbnb account and stay in one of the Airbnb places. The owner claimed that they have 15 apartments which look all the same in Taiwan.

Because of that, I’m not especially nervous, because then I can just take everybody’s side as we have talked about.

                        Let’s start at the beginning then with Uber. You saw these four groups emerge at the beginning of Uber.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        That’s right. Then the four groups are, as I mentioned, roughly, Uber drivers, taxi drivers, Uber passengers, and other passengers. They had almost nothing in common. Then somebody from one of the groups said something that unites the taxi drivers and taxi passengers together.

                    <p>
                        Exactly! The Uber drivers and passenger probably won’t like to see Uber, Inc. being revoked of its company registration. They united around another statement saying, “When I’m not in a hurry, I prefer to call Uber even if there are plenty of taxis just swishing around before me, I still prefer the Uber experience,” and that’s what unites them around.

                        That’s right because it names taxi by name. The thing is that none of these two are what we call group-informed consensus. While they do have more than three-quarter in each group respectively, they manage to convince almost zero percent across groups for obvious reasons. They are divisive statements.

                        However, we said we don’t need hope as agenda of our conversation, anything that can convince a majority across groups. That means it has to be endorsed by those groups. Now, when people see the four groups merging into two, they are now focusing their ideas on convincing the people to the other aisle.

                    <p>
                        They do so by making statements that can first resonate with more in-group people. For example, group one toned down the original statement and a week later, that’s one week into the consultation, they unified around this statement. I think it’s the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation to actively outlaw unlicensed passenger vehicles.

                        This is not about the company anymore. It doesn’t name Uber here. It doesn’t call on MOTC to do anything. It just says it is a duty for MOTC to do law enforcement. This is a much more nuanced message, but in a sense, it’s also more simple. For six, some of this specifically, however, it unites people in a sense of kind of social justice.

                        It managed to convince almost 90 percent of group one. It managed to convince some portion of group two as well, but it’s by far not the majority. It’s maybe halfway there. Group two actually gained some people from group one because somebody proposed a very creative statement, and some people just joined the group two because of that statement.

                        It says this, “Currently, the only way for traditional taxis to survive is to join a taxi fleet whereas they had the option of becoming an individual or a co-op. Currently, only commercial fleets are viable.” That’s the observation. Then, they said, “This is not due to a government policy but it’s just a market reality.”

                        Uber X has subverted this original group. I think it’s quite awesome, almost liberating, to the drivers. This, again, is a social justice statement that wants some people from the taxi drivers and passengers. It managed to convince almost everybody of that group.

People would like their statements to be scored higher on the majority opinion, not just on the intragroup conversation.

                        It’s fine. I’ll stick to the script. Aside from Irvin’s statement, which enjoyed universal support of how the government should change our regulation to address the challenge of Uber so that everybody, even the taxi drivers, can enjoy the same service as provided by the app, the other six consensus items are, very quickly, the ruling about public transportation should be fair.

                        If it’s rental, it should work like a rental. If it’s a taxi, it should work like a taxi. It should be fair regardless of whether it’s an app or not. The second thing is that Uber has the responsibility of explaining its taxation contribution to the society.

                        The third is that Uber X should be just like taxi. It should place the registration plate, the professional driver’s license, as well as the complete information about the driver somewhere that’s visible inside the car, not just on the app.

It’s carpooling, essentially. They think that it should be exempt from the registration. However, even in that case, insurance coverage for passengers is still paramount.

The great thing about pol.is is that it’s very rare, I’ve never encountered a case, where the group-informed consensus are incoherent in a sense that they almost feel like something prepared by a good think tank report, in a sense that they have a logic in it.

                        It’s forced to use those two very lopsided way to gorge the public’s interest. Thinking from the angle of the citizen, if I get a survey telephone, I may want to fill in the blank and say, “This is what I actually think.” It’s never recorded by the person who does the survey. If I join a focus group, I may say, “Actually, I don’t represent the Uber drivers.”

                        We have maybe 4,000 people. Each of them need to have a say. Even as a association leader, I don’t have the time to listen to the 4,000 people. As a citizen, participate, it feels frustrating when you’re being surveyed, or polled, or invited to a focus group because even representatives can’t really know what their constituents think.

                        The consensus items become a new act called a Multi-purpose Taxi Act. That’s entirely in the spirit of those consensus points. Uber decided to not register as a multi-purpose taxi or as an app to facilitate multi-purpose taxi first. They first reentered the market as a service for e-rentals. Then they also went with multi-purpose taxis.

                        Now, using the Uber app, you can call both rental cars as well as taxis. One is metered by hour, the other metered by distance. Through a loophole, there’s a cap on taxi cars but no cap on rental cars. People became rental cars.

                        If you have a driver license, of course. People know that. They were seeing this as the way to break through the cap on taxis. Uber using the existing taxi-car cap can grow maybe only twofold. Using the unlimited rental-car cap, they can grow maybe tenfold. There will be externalities to the road and things like that. The recent regulation change is essentially the MOTC side.

                        Each municipality need to decide for themself whether they want e-rentals to also count as multi-purpose taxis or if they don’t count and you really have to rent them by the hour. That is the entirety of what the MOTC is doing. Personally speaking, I think this rental/taxi separation is still within the idea of the original consensus.

                        If we do need another conversation, it will probably be about how to make multi-purpose taxis more fitting to the current reality. For example, people are saying that hardware meter is very inconvenient. Then you cannot do dynamic pricing. Maybe a app-based meter is a better one.

                        There are some new observations now that we have multi-purpose taxis for a few years now. MPTs is probably a good idea to have that conversation on through vTaiwan. E-rental regulation, it’s still very much well within the original consensus. It is making sure that each municipality do a reality check. That’s my take.

                        In other words, Uber found a way of growing in an area that wasn’t covered by the law that this informed.

                        Right. This created a law. Uber did cooperate with MPTs. They also found a way to cooperate with e-rentals so that e-rentals were not covered by this. At that time, nobody thought that renting a car and asking the driver to sit to the other side would be the possibility of making a multi-purpose taxi. Uber is very creative and found a way in the existing ecosystem.

                        Yes. What I have heard also was e-rental cars that then became multi-purpose taxis is that they very much wish that people can understand the difference between a rental where you sit on the driver’s seat and a taxi where you sit on the passenger’s seat. Currently, they don’t get as much influx of requests as compared to when they operate on the grey area of e-rental.

                        I’ve heard from people who are still driving e-rentals with Uber in a sense of uncertainty. They don’t know, when October comes, whether their operation will still be illegal or that they will be forced to switch to multi-purpose taxis. There are some how to get licenses, that’s already addressed. We have a lot more examinations.

                        There are also parts where the MOTC is working with banks to make sure if they take a loan to buy that car, they can shift into a multi-purpose taxi without suffering any penalties and things like that. All those administrative issues are being worked on.

                        The group that says, “You should allow with some limitation,” or, “Allow with a lot of limitation,” these two groups merged into Group A. That’s it. Yesterday, we talked about a majority of opinions. The top-most one is, “I think Taiwan’s road planning is very unfriendly to pedestrians.”

                        It does have something to do, though. People shared their idea of the impossibility of driving e-bikes or e-scooters on pedestrian pathways. Sometimes, outside of Taipei especially, people start putting stuff on the pedestrian road. Even people in wheelchairs who usually can use the pedestrian pathway have to go to the street and operate in a dangerous zone in the corner of a road.

                    <p>
                        This is pertinent because a lot of the suggestions talks about how they should operate in a cycleway, how they should operate in a pedestrian way. There are many places in Taiwan, many district and municipalities that doesn’t have a designated bicycle way and a pedestrian way is often clogged.

                        That environment is a completely different planning criteria as compared to Taipei, for example. Even in Taipei, there are corners that are not as well-planned. If you say, “Oh, let’s just move on the slower part of the public road,” then another observation, there’s a lot of motorcyclists. The motorcyclists who usually swarm into a red light, that would make the e-scooters dangerous.

                        If you hear two words that form a phrase, your left and right hand will type in the two words simultaneously. It’s chording.

                        I have no idea. I can’t even imagine that. You hit two words at the same time.

                        That’s right. If you hear, for example, the word for democracy, min zhu, your left hand would type M-I-N, and your right hand would type Z-H-U.

                        You’re typing the sound. If you just type zhu, it could be 煮, as in cooking [laughs] or it could be any of the word that sounds alike, the homonyms. If you type two words at a time, there’s very little chance of homonyms.

                        What we’re looking at is the Uber X deliberation back in 2015. We’re looking at one particular statement from the [Mandarin Chinese] that talks something about taxation. Here, we can see Group A, which all probably speaking, that the MOTC, the Ministry of Transportation and Communication, has a duty to do law enforcement against unregistered vehicles.

                        Group B doesn’t quite agree. Group B mostly says, “If I’m not in a rush, even if I see taxis driving by, I will still reach out my phone and call a Uber.” That’s Group B, but Group A doesn’t quite agree with that.

                        Even with the divisions, there’s still a majority opinion forming, for example, that the insurance against accidents is important. It is important for safety as well as the fairness, as well as how government should keep the regulation up-to-date to respond to emergent technical inventions.

                        In the e-scooter pol.is, we can see there’s some statements here talking about “Singapore is the most comprehensive in terms of regulation”; “Insufficient management would lead to proliferation of stranded products in the local area”; “Software and hardware innovations will be seen to be buried without an up-to-date regulation.”

                        Once you agree or disagree, your avatar would move among the different groups. Again, the different groups think differently. One group think that it’s much more like the electric bicycles. You need to have some age limit or with a lot of limit, but it should be allowed overall. The other group doesn’t quite agree.

                        The first group says that the current pedestrian road planning is really bad and that we really need a better-planned sphere of experimentation, a pilot site for this kind of new vehicles to have a chance of showing its social impact and getting people educated about these things. For that, everybody agrees.
