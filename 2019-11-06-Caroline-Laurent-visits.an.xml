                        Our Presidential Hackathon is at the second year. Last time, I talked a little bit about how the president hands out awards that are guaranteed presidential permits that whatever they propose – it could be telemedicine, tele-diagnostics, or things like that – will be realized within 12 months.

                    <p>
                        We kept our promise. They are all realized within a year. Now in more than 100 places – indigenous, and offshore, and so on – nurses can connect to a doctor in mainland Taiwan and then talk through telepresence and make diagnostics and medicine without over relying on helicopters and so on.

                    <p>
                        All this is done. We have telemedicine law and everything. Presidential Hackathon gets street credibility with the civic hackers. This year, we see a record number of proposals and also across the world, we also have an international track. That worked really, really well.

                        One of the winners of the domestic track is specifically I think something that’s really exciting, the use of machine learning to look at all the judgments around illicit financial flows, like Panama Paper thing, and compare it with all the public listed companies disclosures, land price, all the public data, and training a deep learning model like “Minority Report” style to reveal which companies could be actually indicted within the next quarter and so on.

                    <p>
                        I think that is a really interesting use of deep learning, and that puts us at the edge of ethics and the use of algorithms in governance and things like that. I think that’s particularly interesting. It arrived earlier than I would have predicted. Every other cases are pretty good as well.

                        Thank you very much on that. I wanted also to talk with you. I read that in 2017, Tsai Ing-wen gave a speech promoting Taiwan as a digital nation and smart island. I wanted to find out what does it mean. What are the main purposes of that kind of policy, etc.?

                        As part of the sustainable goals like goal 9.c, it’s universal broadband access, broadband as human right. It’s not only a campaign promise, but we deliver on it. As of this year, all the remote, rural – it could be as high as the Yu Shan, 4,000 meters – you still have 10 megabits per second.
                    </p>

                <speech by="#Audrey Tang">
                    <p>
                        It could be as south as the Pacific island of Dongsha and Taiping, which are very far from here. They still have 10 megabits per second 4G connection.4G unlimited is US$16 per month. It’s very affordable. The accessibility rate for those remote and offshore indigenous lands is now at 98 percent.

                        Our ministry of interior just said that they are willing to use helicopters as their training rehearsing runs to help all the other mountains that are above 3,000 meters high, of which there are hundreds, to complete the final two percent.

                    <p>
                        This is important because all the digital governance technologies that we roll out, if we don’t have the broadband access as universal, as affordable, as digital opportunity centers that can give people or lend people tablets that are new and so on, we will be systematically leaving people behind, and we must not let that happen. That’s why we provide digital opportunity centers.

                    <p>
                        That leads me to another thing. I’m not really aware of that, but I heard that in Taiwan, the 5G network is also moving very fast.

                        Yes, very quickly. The TSMC just invested a lot on this technology. Also, because back five years ago, we made a decision that no PRC component can enter into our 4G infrastructure. In the past five years, we’ll have to make a different supply chain.

                    <p>
                        It’s not like we don’t have other companies in Taiwan that are also doing business with the PRC supply chain, but when the domestic needs as well as the other cyber security agencies. As we speak, there’s at the moment a drill going on. The cyber security agencies from all over the world are currently doing a penetration testing of the Taiwan infrastructure.

                        Not only keeping us safe, but also using this methodology to make sure that when we work with other, for example, Pacific islands, Caribbean islands, and so on, to help them on their infrastructure, they can rest assured that no place in the stack is vulnerable to coordinated inauthentic behavior or to advanced persistent threats.

                        It’s a data collaborative arrangement. In Taiwan, many people measure their own air quality. There is air quality, like PM 2.5 sensors like here. It’s used as education material as well to teach data stewardship in basic education as part of environmental activities.

                    <p>
                        There is more than 2,000 of those civil-society-run air detectors.

                    <p>
                        They are the air box. They form a data collaborative where they use ledger technology and so on to keep each other honest. They totally together show a lot of the air qualities that the official detectors are unable to go to.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Conversely, they also want to install air boxes in places where they cannot go to, for example, industrial parks. These are private property. You can’t just break in and bring an air box there. It turns out we own the lamps in the industrial park, so we installed the air boxes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency also set up 10,000 of those air boxes compatible devices. Those together give a much closer to reality picture than just the 77 official high-quality detectors.

                    <p>
                        Like the industry parks. The people setting up the air box, the school teachers, and the EPA. If we rely on each other’s numbers, we have to know that they cannot tamper the numbers after the fact, for example, the day before election.

                        If you tamper the numbers so that it looks like after a certain mayor gets elected, the air gets worse, then it’s not a good idea. We really need not just a data collaborative but also governance around the data collaborative. We need a trust layer, a trust infrastructure. That’s the first thing.

                    <p>
                        The civil IoT, we use the national high-speed computing center to aggregate all the data, normalize it into the same specification, work with distributed ledger technology or DLT practitioners to make sure that it’s an immutable, blockchain-like structure so that people cannot go back and change the number. Even though you own a supercomputer center, you cannot. That’s the trust layer.

                    <p>
                        The second is the application layer. Every year, we allocate a lot of money, I think something like some millions of NT dollars so that anyone who think of novel implementations that can use not just air quality, because we also do water quality, like the high-level waterways, floods, tributary, as well as earthquake early prevention and real-time disaster notifications.

                        It’s not the same as presidential, because many of them are governed by the civil society, by the academic. They probably don’t really want the president saying, “This is going to be my campaign platform,” because they are here to hold the president accountable.

                        Statistics, for sure. Although individual data sets may be private, in the aggregate, of course, is public information. The civil IoT does focus on real-time data. It needs to be produced in a real-time manner.

If they revealed a fine-grained dataset, that would be a compromise of the privacy. But if we agree on the aggregate statistics area about how one populous one area is, that has no privacy concerns.

                        For disaster recovery and prevention, you can very easily see how many people are stranded. For example, if they install some apps, just by the app being able to read the battery level of the phone, you know whether there is electricity supply in that area. I can go on. The idea is that for humanitarian purposes, it’s very useful to have the aggregated data.

                        DSI is the 17th goal of the social innovation.

                        If you reduce the use of rare earth materials but end up producing a ton more CO2, that defeats the purpose. By far, CO2 is the more imminent one. Everything else can actually wait a little bit until we make sure the CO2 picture is more clear.

Worked with New Zealand for three more months after three months of Presidential Hackathon and they co-created their own local AI to do that.

Even if the deployment fails or anything like that, there will be no problem. We just publish the post mortem for everybody else to learn. That’s the spirit of open innovation.
